    "- Sequential refers to <mark>the process of executing commands</mark> created by coding in order.\n",
    "- Although prgrams appear to perform tasks simultaneously due to their high speed, computers <mark>actually process commands in the order specified in the code.</mark>\n",
    "- Naturally, even if the commands are the same, completely <mark>different results</mark> will occur if the order is changed.\n",

    "### 1.2 Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pseudocode is the process of writing commands for the computer to execute in order.\n",
    "- It is a good way to start coding with limited knowledge of programming because it uses everyday language. \n",
    "- It can also serve as a bridge when completing flowcharts and transitioning to actual coding.\n",
    "- It can also be used as a basic guide document among programmers during the implementation phase of the acutal code.\n",
    "- The main goal is to clearly describe and plan what needs to be done for each line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Writing pseudocode and creating flowcharts are two essential steps in the process of designing algorithms and programs. Pseudocode is a high-level description of an algorithm written in human-readable language, while a flowchart is a graphical representation of the algorithm's logical flow using symbols and arrows. Below, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to write pseudocode and create a flowchart:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n",
    "Before you start writing pseudocode or creating a flowchart, make sure you fully understand the problem you are trying to solve. Break down the problem into smaller steps or tasks that need to be performed to reach the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step 2: Write Pseudocode**\n",
    "Pseudocode is a way to outline the algorithm in a language-agnostic manner. It should be easy for anyone with programming knowledge to understand. Here's a general guide for writing pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Use a clear and consistent structure: Pseudocode is meant to be easy to read, so ensure you use proper indentation and spacing to separate different blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Use plain English: Write the steps of the algorithm in simple language, avoiding specific programming syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. Use descriptive variable names: Instead of language-specific variable names, use descriptive names like \"counter\" or \"sum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. Use control structures: Utilize standard control structures like \"if-else,\" \"for,\" \"while,\" and \"do-while\" to describe the flow of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 5. Avoid implementation details: Don't worry about the specific code syntax, but focus on the logical steps needed to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here's an example of pseudocode for finding the sum of the first N natural numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Algorithm: CalculateSumOfNaturalNumbers\n",
    "\n",
    "> Input: N (a positive integer)\n",
    "Output: sum (the sum of the first N natural numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Initialize sum to 0\n",
    "> 2. Initialize counter to 1\n",
    "> 3. Repeat the following steps while counter <= N\n",
    ">    4. Add counter to sum\n",
    ">    5. Increment counter by 1\n",
    "> 6. Display sum\n",
    "> 7. End Algorithm\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step 3: Create a Flowchart**\n",
    "Once you have the pseudocode, you can create a flowchart to visualize the algorithm's logical flow. Flowcharts use symbols and arrows to represent the different steps and decisions in the algorithm. Common flowchart symbols include:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Oval: Represents the start and end of the algorithm.\n",
    "> - Rectangle: Represents a process or action.\n",
    "> - Diamond: Represents a decision or conditional statement.\n",
    "> - Arrow: Represents the flow of the algorithm from one step to another.\n",
